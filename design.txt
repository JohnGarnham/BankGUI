
I store bank accounts into a dynamic sorted array and use a binary
search to quickly search through them. I chose a dynamic sorted array
so that the array is only as large as the current number of
elements. I chose to sort it so that I could use a binary search.
Doing this makes it harder to add new accounts, but it is space-efficient
and quick to search through. I figured that the typical bank would put
more emphasis on searching through accounts than adding or removing bank 
accounts. I did not, however, add a remove() method to my dynamic array
because it was not required in this lab.
